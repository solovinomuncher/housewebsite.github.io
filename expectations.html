                    <h3>Clean up after yourself.</h3>
                    <p>Every time you've finished using the kitchen and dining room area:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wash, dry (with rag or paper towel), and put away your dishes.</li>
                        <li>Wipe down counters and stove (including the circles).</li>
                        <li>Wipe down the table area where you ate.</li>
                        <li>Put away anything you used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A good metric: If you wouldn't run your hands over the area, you should
                        clean it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Every time you've finished using the living room area:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put away anything you used.</li>

                    <h3>Buy communal supplies if shopping.</h3>
                    <p>Check group chat if anyone's noticed any supplies that are needed.</p>
                    <p>Do not assume someone else will do it. Reply to chat saying you'll buy them.</p>
                    <p>
                        Send receipt to Erick. He will charge housemates at the end of the month and 
                        pay back those who bought supplies.
