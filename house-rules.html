                <h2>How do dishes work?</h2>
                <p>When you have dirty dishes, make sure that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All the leftovers are stored or thrown in the trash. If food is really smelly (eg fish, rotten food), take out the trash afterwards.</li>
                    <li>All large pots & pans are washed, hand-dried, and put away.</li>
                    <li>Most dishware & utensils are washed and left on the dish rack to dry.</li>
                    <li>All food bits in the sink filter are tossed in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Leftover dishware (one or two max) can be left on the left of the sink and washed immediately after, the night of, or the morning after.</li>
                    <li>All your dry dishes and utensils are put away.</li>
                    <li>Keep forks & spoons with your plates/bowls/cups and wash them together. Don’t leave utensils in the sink alone!</li>

                <h2>What does it mean when it's my trash week?</h2>
                <p>That means, starting from Monday morning to Sunday night, you are responsible for:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>taking the trash and green or recycling bins to the curb on Monday night and bring them back in, and </li>
                    <li>taking out the kitchen trash and recycling whenever it gets full (and it gets full a couple times in a week, so check often!).</li>
                </ol>

                    be out of town?</h2>
                    <p>Ask a housemate to cover for you. You’ll be responsible for next week’s trash instead.</p>
                    <p>If you forget to take out the trash bins, you’re responsible for next week’s trash as well.</p>

                <p>
                    That means, starting from Monday morning to Sunday night, you and your group (Group 1 or Group 2) 
                    are responsible for a pre-assigned chore, which is on the OurHome app. When you complete it, mark 
                    it as complete on OurHome. You can complete it at any time during the week, but not after, or 
                    else you’ll be charged $32, which will be put towards the next utility bill. 
                </p>

            <section id="oot-chore-week">
                <h2>What if I can’t do my chores, since I’ll be out of town?</h2>
                <p>Complete the chores earlier in the week or ask a housemate to cover you.</p>
                <p>
                    If you don’t do your chores for the week (e.g. any housemate notices floor/counters/rags are dirty 
                    on Monday morning), a Chores fee of $32 will be charged to you via Venmo, which will go towards 
                    the utility bills.

                <h2>Can I have people over? (COVID Edition)</h2>
                <p>
                    Preferably vaccinated, but if not, best to let the housemates know beforehand in case any take issue 
                    with it. If it’s one person staying for less than a day or so, and you know they’ve been taking 
                    proper precautions, sure. If more people/more days, best to let the housemates know beforehand.

                <h2>When do I use the serious group chat?</h2>
                <p>Three scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you need a response from everyone and it’s important.</li>
                    <li>When the house needs to be informed of something that might affect them.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, PM people individually, or in another group chat.</li>

                <p>Let Erick know at least 30 days in advance, preferably as soon as you know.</p>
                <p>
                    On move-out day, take out all your trash & take all your belongings with you, 
                    and leave the room empty for the new housemate. Leave the house key in the room.

                <p>
                    Remind the housemates to clean up after themselves (quickly wipe down counters & stovetop when
                    finished, wash all your dishes, etc.) Point out specific messes (with a picture) on the 
                    serious group chat.

                <h2>Reminders</h2>
                <p>
                    There should be very little clutter and trash on the kitchen table or counters at the end of the 
                    day! Clean up after yourselves, throw away trash and put your things away when you’re done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you use ice cubes from ice trays, try to use the tray with the least amount of ice first. 
                    When the tray runs out, fill it up and use the next tray. DON’T leave near-empty trays behind!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always keep the garage hallway door closed. For better insulation and no bugs/mosquitos going 
                    into the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All lights should be turned OFF when no longer in use. Turn on when you’re the first, turn off 
                    when you’re the last. Lower electric bill!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When washing/drying clothes, set timers to be able to move your clothes as soon as you can. 
                    Other people might need to wash/dry as well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pay rent before the 28th of every month.
